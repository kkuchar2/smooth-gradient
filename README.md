# Gaussian Gradient Generator

This React application enables you to generate Gaussian gradient with customizable distribution.

## Features

- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust the standard deviation and mean to control the distribution of colors in the
  gradient. You can also specify the number of stops to fine-tune the gradient's smoothness.
- **Color Picker:** Choose start and stop colors using a color picker to achieve the desired gradient effect.
- **Real-time Preview:** See the generated gradient in real-time as you adjust the parameters, making it easy to
  experiment and find the perfect gradient for your design.
- ** Dithering:** Enable dithering (by using noise mask) to reduce banding in the gradient, creating a smoother
  transition between colors.
- ** CSS Preview:** Copy the CSS code for the generated gradient to use in your projects.
