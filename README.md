# Smooth Gradient Generator

This React application enables you to generate smooth gradients with customizable Gaussian distribution.

## Features

- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust the standard deviation and mean to control the distribution of colors in the
  gradient. You can also specify the number of stops to fine-tune the gradient's smoothness.
- **Color Picker:** Choose start and stop colors using a color picker to achieve the desired gradient effect.
- **Real-time Preview:** See the generated gradient in real-time as you adjust the parameters, making it easy to
  experiment and find the perfect gradient for your design.

## Distribution Control

The application utilizes a Gaussian function to calculate the weights of each color stop along the gradient. This
technique creates gradients with smoother transitions, enhancing visual appeal. Experimentation is suggested to find
optimal values for parameters such as standard deviation and number of stops. Different colors and element sizes might
require adjustments to parameters for optimal results.

**Note:**
This application is created for fun, and additional features may be added in the future.
